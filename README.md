<img src = "Screenshot/LaunchScreen.png" width = "207" height = "448">

# 2. Main screen
Three Label elements are displayed on the main screen, one of them is a field with the name of the application located at the top of the screen, the other two display temperature indicators. In the center there is a slider that changes the temperature indicators.

<img src = "Screenshot/MainScreen.png" width = "207" height = "448">

# 3. Interaction with the slider
When the slider moves, it transmits the value to the Celsius temperature and then the Fahrenheit temperature value is calculated using the formula.

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img src = "Screenshot/PlusTemp.png" width = "207" height = "448">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
